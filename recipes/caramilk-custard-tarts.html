        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place custard powder in a saucepan. Stir in about 2 tablespoons milk, until smooth and combined. Stir in remaining milk. Place saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, for 8 to 10 minutes or until custard simmers and thickens. Add chopped Caramillk. Stir until smooth. Transfer to a heatproof bowl. Cover surface with plastic wrap. Set aside for 30 minutes to cool. Refrigerate for 1 hour or until cold.</li>

            <li>Place 1 biscuit on top of each hole of 2 x 12-hole round-based shallow patty pans. Bake for 3 to 4 minutes or until biscuits have softened. Working very quickly, use a teaspoon to shape the biscuits into a cup, using the pan as a guide. Cool for 15 minutes.</li>
