        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges.</p>
            <p>Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold.</p>
            <p>I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen.</p>
            <p>These grill up very fast because of the high heat,
            so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>
