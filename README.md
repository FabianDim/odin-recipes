# odin-recipes

This project is a website that will contain various food recipes. This is to mainly consolidate and demonstrate skills in HTML such as: text, images, hyperlinks, page formatting. I will eventually incorporate CSS into it. This also will consolidate my git knowledge with me storing this on GitHub.
